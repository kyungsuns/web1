<h2>HTML</h2>
Welcome to my <strong><u>Web</u> page!</strong>
<br><br><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/" target="_blank" title="HTML5 Specification">HTML, as originally conceived, was to be a language
for the exchange of scientific and other technical documents,
suitable for use by non-document specialists.</a>
HTML addressed the problem of SGML complexity by specifying a small set of structural
and semantic tags suitable for authoring relatively simple documents.
In addition to simplifying the document structure, HTML added support for hypertext.
Multimedia capabilities were added later.
